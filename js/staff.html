              <p>Hannah Buckingham graduated from the University of Nebraska-Omaha in 2013 with a degree

in Elementary Education. In the fall of 2013, she began her teaching career with Omaha Public

Schools in a fourth grade classroom. During the summer of 2015, Ms. Buckingham started

working on her Master’s degree in Elementary Mathematics through the OPS Teacher

Leadership program. It was during a math course held at Nelson Mandela Elementary that she

became intrigued with the school’s unique approach to education. She could not sit back and

watch this school unfold from afar - she knew she had to be a part of it!<p>

</p>Ms. Buckingham is extremely excited to begin her work with the amazing staff and scholoars at

Nelson Mandela this year. “I truly believe that every child can learn if given the resources to do

so. I want to see every student I teach find success each and every day in a variety of ways.

Along with teaching academics, I enjoy helping my students grow into caring, respectful, helpful

citizens who will have a positive impact in their community and the world around them. Above

all, I strive to build positive relationships with my students and create a safe, comfortable

environment for learning.” One of her favorite quotes about teaching says that every child needs

someone who believes in them and pushes them to be the very best version of themselves.

Building relationships with students is her favorite part of the job!</p><p>

“Every child deserves a champion - an adult who will never give up on them, who understands

the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.” - Rita

Pierson</p>

              <p><span>“Success isn’t about how much money you make, it’s about the difference you make in people’s lives.”-Michelle Obama</span></p>
              <p>Annette Foster holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Education and an endorsement in Special Education from Creighton University in Omaha. She also has a Master of Science degree in Reading from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. She has worked for the Omaha Public School system as an elementary and middle school teacher for 35 years until her retirement in the spring of 2014. Annette has taught undergraduate and graduate students, managed after school tutoring programs, designed and written various curriculum and programs and has been a member of numerous educational committees. Along with her daughter, Antoinette Davis, Annette is co-founder of Power of Words Literacy. Part of its mission is to encourage reading, so Power of Words co-hosts literacy fairs with various schools which include games, crafts and free books at no cost to participants.</p>
              <p>Annette’s mission is to inspire her students to be the best they can be in all areas of their lives. She believes every student is unique and has a purpose. She encourages them to explore their talents and interests. She anticipates their needs and keeps them actively engaged in their own learning by using various assessments as tools followed by best practices in education. She believes educators teach more than subjects and concepts, they teach the whole person. She holds her students to high expectations and they know in no uncertain terms that she expects them to achieve. In response to why she is excited to teach the students at Nelson Mandela Elementary she states, “The reward in teaching is the satisfaction of knowing that I make a difference. When I teach, I have the joy of knowing that I was a part of inspiring a generation of teachers, doctors, lawyers, athletes and others. I may never see the end result of my teaching in a student’s life, but I know that I’ve played a part in planting the seeds.”</p>

              <p>My name is Jenae Hines and have two children, James Ray Anthony and Julia RayAnn. I am the oldest of four on my mother’s side and second oldest of four on my father’s side. My hobbies are arts and crafts, spending time outdoors, and singing. Crafts give me an escape where I get a chance to free my mind and create. I enjoy the outdoors over the summer and visit the zoo almost once a week. I really enjoy singing and have performed at a number of different places since I was little. I have a big heart and always want to help in any way that I can. I love working with kids; I truly believe it’s my calling.</p>
              <p>In 2008 I graduated from Omaha South High School and went on to study nursing at Iowa Western Community College. After working as a CNA for OPS, I soon realized nursing was not where I wanted to start my career. I stayed with OPS until April 2015. Though I couldn’t see where I was going at times, I believe my life was headed in a new direction and I think it is safe to say the storm is over for now! I am thankful for the sister I have found in Mrs. Maxwell, fellow Mandela instructor, and for Dr. Toohey for giving me the opportunity to be part of such an amazing establishment.</p>

received an Associates Degree in Early Childhood Education shortly after graduating

high school. While working in the Early Childhood field for more than 10 years,

Tracy’s strong desire to work with low income families and children encouraged her

to pursue a degree in Human Social Services Administration while working for Early

Head Start. Tracy worked with Early Head Start as a home visitor for 3 years which

allowed her to go into homes and work with pregnant and parenting women

connecting them with resources in the community and providing parenting and

child development coaching. Tracy was promoted after receiving her

undergraduate degree as the Family Development Coordinator for the Early Head

Start Program which allowed her to supervise Home Visitors that worked with the

families in the community and take on numerous administrative duties. During 9

years of supervision for the EHS program Tracy wanted to pursue her childhood

dream of teaching. In January of 2010 she received a Masters of Education in

Elementary Education. She began teaching Kindergarten for Omaha Public Schools

              <p>Miranda joins the Mandela team this year as she begins her 13th year in education. 

Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Miranda attended Dordt College in Sioux Center, Iowa

where she received her Bachelors with a double major in Elementary Education and Special

Education.  After completing her student teaching practicum in Chicago, Illinios, Miranda

returned to Omaha to teach with Omaha Public Schools.  While with OPS, Miranda taught

Special Education, Kindergarten, and Second Grade.  During this time, she also returned to

school to earn a Masters of Literacy with an emphasis in ESL from Concordia University in

2007.  The following summer, she spent 6 weeks teaching English in Burundi, Africa to

orphaned boys and girls.  In 2014, Miranda took her love for teaching into a new setting at

the Omaha Home for Boys, as they were in the beginning stages of opening their own on-

campus Rule 18 classroom, where young men were able to recover lost or failed credits

quickly in order to get back on track to graduate high school on time.  </p>

<p>Miranda is so excited to get into the classroom at Nelson Mandela.  She is eager to teach

academics to her scholars and also build strong relationships with scholars and their

families, believing that the two go hand in hand.  Miranda enjoys watching her students

grow and mature as they learn to take healthy risks as learners and discoverers during their

year together in the classroom.  As scholars grow older, Miranda enjoys watching them

grow into young men and women and strives to stay active in their lives. She states,

“Joining the Mandela team is both a privilege and a responsibility. I believe in the mission

and am excited to see how the school continues to evolve and grow.  I can’t wait to see my

students grow and learn and laugh.”</p>

She is passionate about inspiring and motivating children to be better than their circumstances. Maxwell states, “Many people will judge you based upon where you live. Majority of these students have no control over that area in life. They can show the world how intelligent they are while upholding respect, nobility, and grandeur about themselves. You may be in your habitat but you do not have to be a product of your domain if your environment is not conducive to your success.” As Nelson Mandela said, “Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.”</p>
